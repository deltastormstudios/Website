                     So, for those who don't know me. Hi!, my name is Igor Evdokimov, I'm the host of DeltaStorm Studios 
                     and just the average guy that happens to be a moviegeek. So, in other words, I like movies. I like watching
                     them, I like making them.
                     <br>
                     <br>
                     As someone who learned vfx from tutorials and trail and error, it always amazes me, how much there is still 
                     to discover in one program, multiple programs. And so I started a youtube channel, to post the little short videos 
                     i made, because making videos is fun! After a while I wanted to see if I could maybe get a following on youtube,
                     so I started to make tutorials based on my knowledge of after effects. I liked that as well, so, I began to make more
                     and here we are now.
                  </p>
                  <p class="about_paragraph_2">
                     Now I hope to inspire the joy that is vfx and filmmaking through my videos, granted, they aren't great (yet),
                     but they'll get there. One more thing that I want to do is expand to other programs as well, such as houdini,
                     nuke and cinema 4D. So, be on the lookout for more 3D integration in the videos. Enjoy the site and the channel!
